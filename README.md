## What is Moom?

Moom is a professional-grade application that provides unparalleled control over window placement and sizing on your desktop. It addresses the common productivity bottleneck of manually arranging application windows by offering a robust set of automated and customizable features.

At its core, Moom replaces the standard green zoom button with a versatile pop-up menu that gives you immediate access to a grid of possible window positions and sizes. Beyond simple snapping, it enables you to define exact window dimensions, create and save complex layouts for specific projects or applications, and restore those layouts with a single click. The application supports a vast array of keyboard triggers, allowing you to manipulate windows without ever touching the mouse. For power users, Moom offers advanced options like moving windows between displays and focusing specific windows, making it an indispensable tool for anyone looking to optimize their digital workspace for maximum efficiency and a clutter-free environment.
